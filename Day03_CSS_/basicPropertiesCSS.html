        1. Reading/ Understanding
        2. Programming Practise
        3. MCQS
    </p><p id="three" class="para">  <!-- we can use id / para alternately or use both-->
        Identifying the important topics
        1. Go through the syllabus of each module.
        2. Segregate the topics session wise.
        3. Divide the number of Questions by total number of sessions. The result is the total number of Qs from each session. Example: Module has 20 Sessions, there 40/20= 2. Means each session will contribute to 2 Qs.
        4. Focus on the most important concepts of each session and master them. Means — concepts + application in programs + MCQ ( from sanfoundry + Google topic name MCQ).
    </p><p id="4">
        Reading/ Understanding
        1. Go through the syllabus of each module. Each module is divided into multiple sessions. Each session has multiple topics.
        2. Go through each of such topics. First read your notes. If not able to understand, refer to a Youtube Video.
        3. Try to get a clear picture of “what” that topic is about, “how” it works, and “why” it works the way it works. “Why” part is the most difficult and you have to really think hard to arrive at a solution.
    </p><p id="5">
        Programming Practise
        1. Diligently practise your lab work as well as assignments.
        2. Also try to solve 1 hacker rank problem related to the topic which is being taught in class. (this will help you during placements).
        3. Try to solve problems from Geeksforgeeks. Look for the most frequent problems asked in an interview and try to solve them. If you can’t solve, at least understand the solution.
    </p><p id="6">
        MCQs
        1. Solve MCQs topic wise from sanfoundry. Also do look geeksforgeeks for cpp.
        2. Find MCQ for each topic on google. Ex- google search: virtual function cpp mcq. Do atleast first 4–5 pages.
    </p><p id="7">
        MATERIALS NEEDED
        1. OS: GateSmashers youtube + Galvin + class notes
        2. DS: mycodeschool youtube + classnotes
        3. OOPS: Bach book + class notes
        4. C++: Book: c++ effective object oriented software construction by Kayshav Dattatri. ( it’s very difficult to find. But it’s a gem) + class notes
        5. Javascript: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript + notes
        6. HTML/CSS: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css + notes

        CCEE marks and Placements
        1. If you get above 60% in CCEE exam then it’s good. It is important for specially those whose past academics were not good or those who have gaps.
        2. Still, you will get placed. But try to get above 60%. Generally less than 50% students get above 60. Sometimes it’s even 30%. So, it’s an advantage.
